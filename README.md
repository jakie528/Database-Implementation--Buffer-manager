# Database-Implementation--Buffer-manager
# The Structure of the Buffer Manager
The Minirel buffer manager uses three C++ classes:  BufMgr, BufDesc,  and BufHashTbl. There will be one instance of the BufMgr class.  A key component of this class will be the actual buffer pool which consists of an array of NUMBUFS frames,  each the size of a database page.    In addition to this array, the BufMgr instance also contains an array of NUMBUFS instances of the BufDesc class which are used to describe the state of each frame in the buffer pool.   A hash table is used to keep track of which pages are currently resident in the buffer pool.  This hash table is  implemented by an instance of the BufHashTbl class. This instance will be a private data member of the BufMgr class.  These classes are described in detail below.
